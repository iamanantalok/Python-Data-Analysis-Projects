With the advent of online booking platforms, consumers have access to a vast range of hotels, from budget to luxury, at their fingertips.According to recent statistics, there are around 700,000 hotels worldwide, and the number is constantly growing. Similarly, the online hotel booking industry is also on the rise, with a projected market size of USD 174.9 billion by 2023.\n","\n","To succeed in this highly competitive market, it is crucial to understand the patterns and parameters of hotel booking from a business point of view. The datasets related to hotel bookings contain valuable information, such as customer reviews, ratings, prices, and availability, which can be analyzed to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences. In this project, we conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify such patterns and gain insights into customer behavior.\n","\n","After cleaning and merging the datasets, we performed a generalized analysis to understand the trends and patterns in hotel bookings. We focused on types of Hotel they choose, how customer accessed the stay - corporatebooking/Direct/TA, number of additional requirements, deposit type, which country have  most guest coming, numbers of weekend vs weekdays bookings exploring the relationship of these factors. \n","\n","After analyzing the data related to hotel bookings, we found several interesting patterns and trends. One of the most important factors that influence the customer's choice of hotel is the type of hotel they prefer. Our analysis revealed that customers tend to choose budget hotels over luxury hotels, indicating that price plays a significant role in their decision-making process.\n","\n","We also analyzed how customers access their hotel stays, whether it is through corporate booking, direct bookings, or travel agencies (TA). We found that direct bookings are the most preferred method, followed by corporate bookings and TA bookings. This indicates that customers prefer to have control over their bookings and want to avoid extra fees associated with TA bookings.\n","\n","Furthermore, our analysis showed that customers have varying additional requirements, such as room types, meals, and transportation, which they add to their bookings. We also found that customers prefer to book hotels with a refundable deposit, indicating that flexibility is a crucial factor for them.\n","\n","In terms of location, we found that certain countries, such as the United States, China, and Germany, have the highest number of guests visiting. This information can be used by hotel businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and services to attract more customers from these countries.\n","\n","Finally, we explored the relationship between the number of weekend versus weekday bookings and found that there is a higher demand for hotel bookings on weekends. This highlights the importance of managing hotel inventory and pricing strategies to optimize profits."],"metadata":{"id":"F6v_1wHtG2nS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **GitHub Link -**"],"metadata":{"id":"w6K7xa23Elo4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Provide your GitHub Link here."],"metadata":{"id":"h1o69JH3Eqqn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Problem Statement**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yQaldy8SH6Dl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The increasing trend of online hotel booking has resulted in a highly competitive market, with a projected market size of USD 174.9 billion by 2023.
